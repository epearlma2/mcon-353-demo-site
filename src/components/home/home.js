                        The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden
                        chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family.
                        Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the
                        smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano)
                        in the family in regular use. The violin typically has
                        four strings (some can have five), usually tuned in
                        perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most
                        commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It
                        can also be played by plucking the strings with the
                        fingers and, in specialized cases, by striking the
                        strings with the wooden side of the bow.

                        The flute is a family of classical music instrument in
                        the woodwind group. Like all woodwinds, flutes are
                        aerophones, meaning they make sound by vibrating a
                        column of air. However, unlike woodwind instruments with
                        reeds, a flute is a reedless wind instrument that
                        produces its sound from the flow of air across an
                        opening. According to the instrument classification of
                        Hornbostelâ€“Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown
                        aerophones. A musician who plays the flute is called a
                        flautist or flutist.

                        family. Its four strings are usually tuned in perfect
                        fifths: from low to high, C2, G2, D3 and A3. The viola's
                        four strings are each an octave higher. Music for the
                        cello is generally written in the bass clef, with tenor
                        clef, and treble clef used for higher-range passages.

                        country, and other styles. Songs are typically short to

                        Compared to pop music, rock places a higher degree of
                        emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an
                        ideology of authenticity.

                        A genre of popular African-American music that
                        originated in the 1940s as urbane, rocking, jazz based
                        music with a heavy, insistent beat. Lyrics focus heavily
                        on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of
                        relationships, freedom, economics, and aspirations.

                <h4>The Voice of Music</h4>
                <p class="poem">
                  Music, oh music, the language of the soul,
                  <br></br>A melody that makes us feel whole,
                  <br></br>
                  From the beat of the drums to the strum of a chord,
                  <br></br>
                  It brings us together, in perfect accord.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  In notes and rhythms, it speaks to our heart,
                  <br></br>A symphony of emotions that sets us apart,
                  <br></br>
                  It can make us dance, it can make us weep,
                  <br></br>
                  And take us to places, we never thought we'd keep.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>A voice that echoes, across the land,
                  <br></br>A universal language, we all understand,
                  <br></br>
                  In joy and sorrow, it brings us peace,
                  <br></br>
                  And fills our hearts, with a sweet release.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  From classical to rock, and all in between,
                  <br></br>
                  Music is the magic, that makes life serene,
                  <br></br>
                  It touches our souls, and sets us free,
                  <br></br>A gift that brings us, eternal harmony.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  So let us embrace, this beautiful art,
                  <br></br>
                  And let the music, speak to our heart,
                  <br></br>
                  For it is the rhythm, that keeps us alive,
                  <br></br>
                  And gives us the strength, to thrive and survive.
                  <br></br>
